## 6. Can you provide examples of how simplifying terms (e.g., "start" instead of "initiate") improves comprehension?

Here are some examples of simplifying terms to improve comprehension:

1. 'Start' instead of 'Initiate': "Start the engine" is clearer than "Initiate the engine's ignition process."
2. 'Use' instead of 'Utilize': "Use the software" is simpler than "Utilize the software's capabilities."
3. 'Get' instead of 'Obtain': "Get a quote" is more direct than "Obtain a quotation."
4. 'Make' instead of 'Fabricate': "Make a copy" is clearer than "Fabricate a reproduction."
5. 'Show' instead of 'Demonstrate': "Show me the data" is simpler than "Demonstrate the data's significance."
6. 'Help' instead of 'Assist': "Help me with this task" is more concise than "Assist me in completing this task."
7. 'Find' instead of 'Locate': "Find the answer" is clearer than "Locate the solution."
8. 'Save' instead of 'Preserve': "Save the file" is simpler than "Preserve the document's integrity."
9. 'Open' instead of 'Activate': "Open the account" is more direct than "Activate the account's features."
